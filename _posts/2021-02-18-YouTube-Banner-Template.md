Have you ever searched "YouTube banner template" on Google in the attempt of finding a full-resolution image to use in your project?
I have, and I could never find a full resolution usable image, only Photoshop templates and such, which I didn't want to use.

I'll be quick and brief, here's the image you were looking for:

![youtube banner template](/images/youtube_banner_template.png)

Right click on the image and select "Save image...", you're pretty much done. If it doesn't work click [here](/images/youtube_banner_template.png).

I hope this resource will be useful for your project, happy designing!
