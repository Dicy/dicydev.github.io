## Welcome DicyDev's projects website

DicyDev is a team founded by [Lorenzo Lapucci](https://github.com/AlexDicy), it aims to build interesting and useful content.
Currently, we're working and have worked on many different projects such as:

### [DicyVPN](https://dicyvpn.com)

Responsive and stable VPN service that provides privacy with low latency and allows you to access game servers and websites when your network blocks access.

### DicyPlay (discontinued)

Minecraft network built on top of custom plugins and automated scalability.

### DeviBase (discontinued)

Check common items' specs for Monitors and cables.<br>
Is the monitor you wish to buy compatible with HDMI you need?<br>
DeviBase is the repository for device specs.

### Antony Escape (discontinued)

It's a game with a great storyline behind it. The preview is not available yet, the project is in its early stages! (discontinued)
